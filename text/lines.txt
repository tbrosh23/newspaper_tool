London, July 31--Much satisfaction is
expressed in official and mercantile cir-
cles at the prospective settlement of the
seal question by aid of the Washington
conference, especially as such an arange-
ment will remove the cause of irritation
between the United States and Great
Britian.  On the proposal of Mr. Foster's
journey diplomats ridiculed the idea that
there was anything necessary to be done.
