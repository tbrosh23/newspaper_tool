London, July 31--Much satisfaction is
expressed in official and mercantile cir-
cles at the prospective settlement of the
seal question by aid of the Washington
conference, especially as such an arange-
ment will remove the cause of irritation
between the United States and Great
Britian. On the proposal of Mr. Foster's
journey diplomats ridiculed the idea that
there was anything necessary to be done.
Ambassador Hay and Mr. Foster have
completely changed this idea and Great
Britain is doing everything possible to
meet the views of the United States.
Doubtless this is partly owing to the
support Mr. Foster's idea received from
Russia and Canada. Sir Willfred Lau-
rier and Mr. Davies have all along fa-
vored a conciliatory attitude toward the
proposals of the United States. The
conference will meet in the third or
fourth week in October, the exact date
being left to be determined by the arrival
of the British experts from the sealing
grounds. Great Britain will be repre-
sented by Sir Julian Pauncefote, the am-
bassador, and Prof. Darcy Thompson,
the United States will probably be rep-
resented by John W. Foster, Japan by
the Japanese Minister at Washington,
and Russia by a commission headed by
Dr. Martens, professor of international
law at the University of St. Petersburg,
who was delegated by Russia to hold the
pour parleur with Mr. Foster. Canada
